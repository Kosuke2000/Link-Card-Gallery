## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Kosuke2000/Link-Card-Library.git
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
